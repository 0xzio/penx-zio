## About the builder

Two year ago, I left @Binance and become a freelancer, I started PenX as a passion project.

I am a long-term thinker, and PenX is a product that I really like and believe is worth my long-term investment. In the coming years, I will dedicate all my energy to improving PenX.

There’s no massive team or investors pushing for growth at any cost,just me, running a self-funded, sustainable business. PenX will be supported by its customers, and I have no plans to seek venture funding, which means it’s built to last. I fully expect to still be running it ten years from now.

I personally respond to every email, and deeply care about the problems about PenX.
